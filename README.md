For the execution of the notebooks, create a virtual environment with at least Python 3.6! Once activated, install the following dependencies with

		pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Start up the jupyter-notebook server and run the notebooks. Note: Depending on your operating system it may be necessary to install further libraries to get things running (especially for tensorflow and opencv-python). If necessary, downgrade in the requirements.txt
